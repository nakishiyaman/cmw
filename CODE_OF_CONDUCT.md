# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a welcoming experience for everyone.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

* The use of inappropriate language or imagery
* Personal attacks or derogatory comments
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information without permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project team at
noreply@example.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly
and fairly.
